Logo Scanner is a 3rd year Software Engineering project conducted at the University of Glasgow. We were given a real-life client - in our case ResDiary (https://www.resdiary.com/) - who tasked us with a 9 month long project to develop a mobile application. The premise of the project was to create an application that can recognise a restaurant logo and in near real-time, display pertinent information about the restaurant to the user.

## Project Details
Our project management processes such as issue tracking and milestones were conducted within the GitLab environment.
