Restaurant Logo Scanner is a 3rd year Software Engineering project conducted at the University of Glasgow under the Team Project 3 (TP3) course.

> The TP3 and PSD3 courses are an integral and distinctive part of any Glasgow Computing Science degree. They allows students to experience ﬁrst hand the many issues concerning eﬀective teamwork as well as the various aspects of the software lifecycle in some depth. The TP3 course lasts the whole academic year. Each team will work with a real world project customer from the problem domain to negotiate the requirements and agreed schedule for their individual project

Our customer was **ResDiary** (https://www.resdiary.com/) who are one of the world's leading providers of online restaurant reservations, seating over 13.9 million diners per month across more than 8,100 restaurants in 59 countries. ResDiary tasked us with developing a mobile application that can recognise a restaurant logo and in near real-time, display pertinent information about the restaurant to the user. The goal of the application was to increase the dicoverability of ResDiary's restaurants.

## Project Details
Our project management processes such as issue tracking and milestones were conducted within the GitLab environment. Throughout the project, we used Slack as our method of communication within the team and with the customer.
